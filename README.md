# Particle Simulator
A silly particle simulator made in PyGame using Python as the programming language.
I simply add some physics rules for the particles, i.e., push and pull force based on distance, which color pushes/pulls other colors.

The source code can be found here. The `.exe` executable for Windows can be found in the `dist` directory.
